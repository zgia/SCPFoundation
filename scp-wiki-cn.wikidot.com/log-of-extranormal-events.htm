<p><strong>Event Description:</strong> $237,981 manifested simultaneously, spread across various countries on flat surfaces at approximately $1.3 per square kilometer. This money changed to a different currency depending on the country it manifested within.<br />
<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 5/9/2014<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> World wide.<br />
<strong>Follow-Up Actions Taken:</strong> None, due to the very obscure nature of the event, and that 87% of all the manifested money was made unusable from external forces.</p>
<p><strong>Event Description:</strong> The PA system in a Giant Eagle supermarket announced, &quot;Attention Giant Eagle shoppers: the ritual will now commence,&quot; whereupon all individuals within the store stopped what they were doing and hummed an intricate series of notes for approximately five minutes. After another tone, the humming ceased and all affected individuals resumed their business as though nothing had occurred.<br />
<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 10/10/2014<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> Columbus, Ohio<br />
<strong>Follow-Up Actions Taken:</strong> Event would not have come to Foundation attention if not for discovery on security footage during in-store theft investigation. Individuals affected during event have no memory thereof. As such, it has been determined that attempting to identify and interview each person visible on the tape is unfeasible. Videos confiscated, amnestics administered to store staff, and Foundation agents stationed at Giant Eagle supermarkets to monitor for future events or signs of PA system tampering.<br />
<strong>Update:</strong> As of 27/04/2016, surveillance of Giant Eagle stores has produced no further evidence of anomalous activity. Agents recalled.</p>

<p><strong>Event Description:</strong> Between 16:00:04 UST and 19:53:02 UST, black hole Cygnus X-1 underwent a series of rapid fluctuations in registered x-ray flux density, up to 194.2% of the normal value. When converted into Morse Code, the fluctuations spelled out an expanded, 2018 updated version of the 1988 book <em>A Brief History of Time</em> by the recently deceased physicist Stephen William Hawking. Analysis shows the writing style of the updates to be consistent with that of the original author.<br />
<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 3/14/18<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> Cygnus X-1<br />
<strong>Follow-Up Actions Taken:</strong> Non-Foundation observers were administered Class-A Amnestics, and the observation data in question was covered up.

<p><strong>Event Description:</strong> During a Toys R Us staff meeting, an employee later identified as William J. Horack stood, announced, &quot;Well, guess I won't need these anymore,&quot; and removed his lips with one hand. Afterward, he began to consume the remaining flesh around his mouth &#8212; described by witnesses as having the appearance of &quot;pulled pork&quot; &#8212; as the other employees returned to normal operations. Horack continued to autocannibalize over the course of the day, captured only intermittently by security cameras despite not leaving the meeting room. At 19:05, Horack had been reduced to skeletal remains, which then vanished. Eyewitnesses reported confusion that the event did not strike them at the time as being out of the ordinary.<br />
<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 15/03/2018<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> Mayfield Heights, Ohio, USA<br />
<strong>Follow-Up Actions Taken:</strong> Amnestics distributed to store employees and customers after interviews conducted. Investigation of security cameras revealed no fault. No personal information about William Horack could be attained, and all documentation involved in his three-year employment at Toys R Us appeared to be an intricate forgery. Lips retrieved from initial event location, determined to be thin plastic.</p>
<p><strong>Event Description:</strong> Over the course of five days, the entire student population of ██████ ██ Elementary School in ██████, Ohio developed allergies to all nut-based food products.

At the time no actual anomaly was found and operations proceeded as normal. In 1984 Site-15 underwent a routine casual scan which detected retro-casual ectoentropic interference in the events of his death which was confirmed by further scans. To this day the actual alterations made and the entity responsible are unknown.<br />
<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 06/13/1977<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> Site-15<br />
<strong>Follow-up Actions Taken:</strong> ███████ █████'s family was told that he died in a civilian construction operation. Deconstruction was completed in 1978 despite set-backs. The event was extensively investigated but no more more information has been gained. It is theorized that the Foundation's methods of detecting these events are flawed and simply reading a false negative but similar malfunctions have not been noted. The records of Site-15 were examined but none of the tests run in the Specialized Laboratory 4389-UC!S-11 had any known retrocasual or ectoentropic properties.</p>

<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> ██/██/2010<br />
<strong>Date of Public Information Dispersal:</strong> ██/██/2011<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> ██████████, Italy<br />
<strong>Follow-up Actions Taken:</strong> A cover story was created regarding supposed flaws in experimental procedure, and Foundation operatives embedded within physics research institutions published high-profile rebuttals of the <em>Nature</em> paper. By mid-2012, the scientific consensus on the incident was that the measurement was inaccurate and the result of a faulty timing mechanism.</p>
<p><strong>Event Description:</strong> A high speed heavy goods train entered the mouth of the &quot;Channel Tunnel&quot; that links France and England, heading northbound for London. 45 seconds after the head of the train entered the tunnel, the entire train was within the tunnel. 2 seconds after the rear of the train had entered the tunnel, footage of the head of the train exiting the tunnel was recorded, and the remainder of the train was out of the tunnel after an additional 45 seconds. The &quot;Channel Tunnel&quot; is 50.45 kilometers (31.35 miles) long; as such, the train would have had to travel at a speed exceeding 3664&#160;km/h (2401 mph) in order to travel the required distance. Security footage inside the tunnel went static during the entire event, and a speed recorder on the second engine in line indicated that the train did not exceed 153&#160;km/h (~95 mph) at any point during the trip. The leading locomotive was found to contain [DATA EXPUNGED] inside the fuel tank, as well as six (6) large tubes sticking out of the engine block that were linked directly to the traction motors of the locomotive. (The purpose of these tubes as well as how they function is unclear.) A rail worker in charge of maintaining the engine indicated that he had been &quot;experimenting&quot; with the locomotive the night before the incident.<br />
<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 09/09/2019<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> &quot;Channel Tunnel&quot;, England/France<br />
<strong>Follow Up Actions Taken:</strong> The driver and all witnesses were interviewed and provided Class B amnestics prior to release. The driver of the train did not report anything abnormal, but did say that the trip &quot;seemed a bit quicker than normal&quot;. The rail worker who modified the locomotive is currently held at Site-11 for further questioning; the locomotive is currently stored at Site-53 pending further analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Event Description:</strong> On the 12/██/200█ at 16:02 UTC a Cessna 172 Skyhawk aircraft vanished off radar screens at an altitude of 2100 Ft (640 Meters) near the city of Inverness, Scotland, UK. It re-emerged out of a lone cumulus cloud at an altitude of 1100 Ft (335 Meters) at 17:27 UTC roughly near where it was last seen. Radio contact was achieved between air traffic control (ATC) and the pilot where a long dialogue was exchanged, where the ATC mentioned that he (the pilot) had been missing for almost 1 hour and 30 minutes. In the recorded audio, the pilot could be heard slightly panicking, saying that he flew into a &quot;mere cumulus cloud&quot; and took less than a minute to emerge out on the other side only to find out the sun had abruptly changed position in the sky, he had rapidly lost altitude and noticed that there were no other clouds around when he &quot;clearly sighted multiple other clouds&quot; before he entered the said cumulus cloud. The pilot, who has been identified as John █████, landed safely at Inverness airport with no issues shortly after.<br />
<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 12/██/200█ 16:02 UTC &#8212; 17:27 UTC<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> 28 Km (17 mi) directly south of Inverness, Scotland, UK.<br />
<strong>Follow Up Actions Taken:</strong> All people who witnessed or knew about the event, including the ATC, airport staff and responding personnel, were administered Class A Amnestics by Foundation operatives disguised as local police. All audio recordings have been seized by the Foundation for further research. As for pilot Mr █████, he is currently being held at Site-<strong>[REDACTED]</strong> undergoing further interrogation. The Cessna 172 aircraft is in storage at Site-77 awaiting further examination for any clues that could solve this event.</p>
<p><strong>Event Description:</strong> On the ██/██/2003 at 00:14 UTC (21:14 local time) a large bright object was seen traveling across the night sky south west of the town of Ushuaia, southern Argentina. Initially it was thought to be a meteor, and witness accounts reported how its brightness increased to rival that of Venus, and it traveled rather fast in the sky before fading away and disappearing completely. Roughly an hour later many people within a 100 Km radius began to experience anomalous symptoms including rashes, persistent vomiting, and a high fever. People who were closest to the location of the bright object experienced worse symptoms that vaguely resembled that of the Black Death, Formally known as the Bubonic Plague.<br />
<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> ██/██/2003<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> 17 Km south west of Ushuaia, Southern Argentina.<br />
<strong>Follow Up Actions Taken:</strong> Uninfected witnesses administered Class A amnestics; All who experienced non-life threatening symptoms given appropriate medical treatment and administered Class B amnestics subsequently; People who experienced major symptoms were flown to Buenos Aires for further treatment, and were administered Class B amnestics by personnel disguised as hospital staff. The Foundation decided to take 3 of the heavily-infected and place them in medically induced comas. As of 15/██/2003, they remain in Site-<strong>[REDACTED]</strong>, where researchers are inspecting and examining the unidentified (supposedly extra-terrestrial) virus and their effects on the human subjects.</p>
<p><strong>Event Description:</strong> On the 27th of November, 20██, at 12:34, a large humanoid appeared outside of the city of Athens, Greece. Said humanoid closely resembled a human, with all the physical traits of a <em>Homo Sapiens Sapiens</em>, except for its size that reached 35 meters in height. The humanoid entity proceeded to walk towards the city, before it met with a significant portion of the city's police department,which tried to stop its approach.<br />
<strong>Date of Occurence:</strong> 27/11/20██<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> 15km outside of the city of Athens, Greece<br />
<strong>Follow-up actions taken:</strong> Foundation personnel arrived shortly after the entity's manifestation, but at the time of their arrival (12:45) the entity completely disappeared, with no apparent reason or outside stimuli. Class A amnestics administered to all police personnel present, and after an agreement with the Greek prime minister, all accounts of the event where erased from police records. Cover story A67 (&quot;manhunt&quot;) was applied as an explanation for the Foundation presence on site.</p>
<p><strong>Event descripption:</strong> During the standard Saturday evening CNN news broadcastt, journalist ████ ██████ started loudly vocalizing the phrase &quot;Peanuts on my juice! Peanuts on my juice!&quot; This behavior continued for another 2 minutes, before resuming the interview as normmal.<br />
<strong>Date of Occurence:</strong> █/██/20██<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> The CNN studio<br />
<strong>Follow-up actions taken:</strong> None. Why should the Foundation address this? Remmove thiis from the log.<br />
<em>Note: The aforementioned phrase yelled by the journalist seemed to have strong memetic effects to witnesses. All witnesses remain, up until today,convinced that nothing unusual happened that evening, including Foundation personnel, and the moron that suggested this to be removed from the log. It also seems to signficantly clutter written documents aout it, making words that are either inappropriate for the particular sentence, mispelled, or with doubled letters appear. As a base shielded against memetic hazards, we took the responsibility to add this Event to the database, as none else would.<br />
