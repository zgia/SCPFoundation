<li><strong>Layer 1:</strong> The walls of Layer 1 are coated thinly with a viscous, translucent white organic liquid, including the outer surfaces of the elevator doors. Genetic material matching that of multiple apian species have been recovered from the substance.<br />
<br />
The floor and ceiling are composed of an anomalous dark gray beeswax-titanium alloy that has shown to be completely bulletproof. The walls are made of concrete and are in a slightly damaged state. However, small amounts of apian DNA has been recovered from dust samples.<br />
<br />
Layer 1 is completely devoid of furniture, and the only sources of light are dim fluorescent lights placed along the top of the walls. The lights are presumably powered by an anomalous source.<br />
<br />
The walls bordering Layer 2 have 17 entrances leading to the inside.<br />
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span></li>
<li><strong>Layer 2:</strong> The floor and ceiling of Layer 2 is composed of another different beeswax-titanium alloy that emits a dim, irregularly pulsating yellow-tinted light via unknown means. Spectrometric analysis has confirmed that the EM spectrum of the light emitted from the alloy matches no stable element or compound that occurs naturally, though it is possible to replicate the spectrum via synthetic molecules.<br />
<br />
The walls of Layer 2 are composed of concrete painted white with chalk-based paint. Depictions of bees and wasps in various sizes and styles are present on the surface of the walls. The pictures have shown to be non-anomalous in nature.<br />
<br />
A total of 17 plastic benches are present along the inner wall of Layer 2. The benches are composed of non-anomalous PVC plastic, though the outside of their surfaces are coated with a different, slightly less viscous organic liquid similar to those coating the walls of Layer 1. The benches are approximately 2 meters wide with small protrusions, presumably used as tables, on either side. The benches possess multiple engravings in an unknown language, and a symbol resembling a bee is present in the center of the back panels. Notably, each bench engraving contains different text.<br />
<br />
The inner wall of Layer 2 is cylindrical, unlike the outer wall bordering Layer 1. Two entrances are present on opposite sides of the wall leading into Layer 3.<br />
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span></li>
<li><strong>Layer 3:</strong> Layer 3 is a large cylindrical room located in the center of the area. It is illuminated only by a single bright spotlight attached to the center of the ceiling. The ceiling of Layer 3 is placed significantly higher than the average ceiling height of the hospital, and appears to be a hollow hemispherical dome.<br />
<br />
The walls, floor, and ceiling of Layer 3 are entirely covered in a dark red velvet-like cloth. Analysis of samples revealed that the material used in the cloth is both genetically and structurally identical to the hair of a honeybee.<br />
<br />
In the center of Layer 3 is a smooth white cylindrical pedestal composed of a different beeswax-titanium alloy. A single non-anomalous corpse of a honeybee is present on the top of the pedestal, illuminated by the light above it.<br /></li>

All items said subject is carrying (including other humans) will be teleported along with the subject. However, if the subject is not in contact with the swingset after 4 seconds, only the swingset will return. If another subject sits on the swingset while it is on Titan, said subject will return along with the swingset. The transit takes approximately 1.2 to 1.3 hours, due to it occuring at light speed. However, the transit will appear instantaneous to the passenger(s).<br />
<strong>Date of Containment:</strong> 1981-07-13<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> Atacama Desert, Chile<br />
<strong>Security Protocol:</strong> On May 1982, Site-34 was constructed around the location, and following multiple tests to ensure safe transit between Earth and Titan, the Foundation space project “Good Hope” was initiated on December of that year.<br />

Following several more missions, a temporary pressurized base (Extraterrestrial Outpost-12) was constructed on the immediate area around the arrival location. On October 1985, the second-generation Carrier Suits<sup class="footnoteref"><a id="footnoteref-4" href="javascript:;" class="footnoteref" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> (TC-G02) were completed and the construction of a permanent Site on Titan was initiated following Ethics Committee approval. Meanwhile, Site-34 was expanded and renamed as the Sophia Light Space Center (LSC), and currently functions as a hub for other space missions and research projects.<br />
The permanent base (designated Site-72) was completed 6 years later on October 1991. Site-72 currently functions as a center for research and Outer Solar System exploration. As of this time, Site-72 houses approximately 1,300 personnel and a total of ██ exploration missions have been conducted from Site-72.</p>

<p><strong>Location Description:</strong> A one story rental log cabin that causes people inside to forget important items, such as wallets and phones, which leads to the person who left the item returning and then forgetting another item, causing subjects to return over and over until they are reminded about their lost object.<br />
<strong>Date of Containment:</strong> ████-██-2017<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> █████, Michigan, USA<br />
<strong>Security Protocol:</strong> The Cabin is to remain closed at all times, with cameras around the building in order to prevent break-ins.<br />
Note: The longer a subject spends in the cabin, the more likely they are to forget something.</p>
<p><strong>Location Description:</strong> A floor of a residential building where a pancake is perpetually present. The pancake cannot be removed by any known means, and removing the portion of the floor directly underneath the pancake will result in the pancake attaching onto the nearest undamaged floor until the original floor is restored.<br />
<strong>Date of Containment:</strong> ████-██-██<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> [REDACTED], AZ<br />
<strong>Security Protocol:</strong> The building has been bought and is being secured by personnel from a nearby site.</p>
<p><strong>Location Description:</strong> A sidewalk where pedestrians are only able to walk while their eyes are closed. Attempting to walk with open eyes invariably causes said pedestrian to expel a large amount of liquid resembling vomit from the mouth via unknown means.<br />
The composition or appearance of the substance is completely unrelated to the contents of the affected person's stomach.<br />
<strong>Date of Containment:</strong> 2019-██-██<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> Jeju, South Korea<br />
<strong>Security Protocol:</strong> The surrounding area was purchased and is being monitored for further anomalous activity.</p>
<p><strong>Location Description:</strong> A small portion of the ground in a concrete parking lot where entities resembling spotted garden eels sporadically emerge from multiple holes in the ground.<br />
The entities behave as if they are sumberged in a viscous substance similar to water, and demanifest when their entire body enters back into the hole they emerged from.<br />
The entities are able to consume various metals, and appear to favor a diet of metal over that of plankton.<br />
If a hole is filled or blocked, another hole will appear in its vicinity via unknown means.<br />
<strong>Date of Containment:</strong> 2019-07-07<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> Parking lot in Site-19 Facility 23<br />
<strong>Security Protocol:</strong> Due to its location, security protocol is unnecessary at this time. The entities are being fed daily by employees.</p>
<p><strong>Location Description:</strong> A small beehive containing anomalous chocolate-producing stingless bees, located on a cultivated Theobroma cacao tree beside the parking lot of Site-19 Facility 23.<br />
The beehive was not noted to have existed prior to containment and the bees have been designated under the Foundation's expanded biological kingdom classification as Melipona cocoa.<br />
<strong>Date of Containment:</strong> 2019-██-██<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> ███████, USA<br />
<strong>Security Protocol:</strong> As the bees are of the stingless variety and are limited to Foundation interaction only, no active security measures are needed to protect them from the public.<br />
<em>Note: Researchers are advised not to disturb the bees without an adequate research proposal, as the bees are currently the only known colony of their species. If any researchers are caught attempting to steal chocolate from the beehive, they will be severely disciplined. - Facility Director Arthur Hackett</em></p>
<p><strong>Location Description:</strong> A massive empty house seemingly in perfect condition. All persons in its proximity consider ever buying, selling, desecrating, or entering it to be completely unthinkable. Affected are always incapable of realizing the illogic in this, no matter the circumstances.<br />
<strong>Date of Containment:</strong> ████-██-██<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> Boston,Massachusetts,USA<br />
<strong>Security Protocol:</strong> The location is benign, and its nature ensures no amnestic application is needed. Body mics and cameras on personnel in the area are configured to automatically record when in proximity for survey purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Location Description:</strong> A two story house where all water on the property is always at 95°F (35°C), regardless of the conditions surrounding the property. Built in 1949, the house has had all plumbing replaced at least once, and as such the house itself is not the source of the anomaly.<br />
<strong>Date of Containment:</strong> 11/20/1959<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> ██████████, Pennsylvania, USA<br />
<strong>Security Protocol:</strong> Under ownership of Dr. Marques, who resides there.</p>
<p><strong>Location Description:</strong> A spot in the Hudson Bay with a radius of 0.7 Km where gravity is 8% weaker than normal. Every year, this spot appears to 'orbit' around the coordinates <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=52%C2%B035%2706.81%22+N+79%C2%B045%2711.01%22+W&rlz=1C1GGGE_enGB776GB776&oq=52%C2%B035%2706.81%22+N+79%C2%B045%2711.01%22+W&aqs=chrome..69i57.883j0j0&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8" target="_blank">52°35'06.81&quot; N 79°45'11.01&quot; W</a> from a distance of 0.5 Km and completes a full circle every 4 years.<br />
<strong>Date of Containment:</strong> 16/07/2002<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> 10 Km North west of Weston island, Hudson Bay.<br />
<strong>Security Protocol:</strong> It still resides in the same area (52°35'06.81&quot; N 79°45'11.01&quot; W) and researchers have theorized it to be linked to the decrease of gravity in the <a href="https://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/earth/geophysics/missing-gravity.htm" target="_blank">Hudson Bay</a> region, although this still remains unclear.</p>
<p><strong>Location Description:</strong> A forest in Savannah, Georgia that plays the subject's favorite song from an unidentified location. If the subject does not have a favorite song the subject will hear roars, car crashes, and static.<br />
<strong>Date of Containment:</strong> 4-23-2016<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> █████, GA, USA<br />
<strong>Security Protocol:</strong> The remoteness of this specific forest does not warrant buying and securing it, however any civilians going in or out of the forest are to be administered Class-B amnestics.</p>
<p><strong>Location Description:</strong> A room on ███████ building of the Centre Europeene des Recherches Nuckleaires (CERN) . The door does not lead to the normal room's interior, but to the sun's core, with all of its normal characteristics (very high temperature, gaseous nature, high thermonuclear activity, etc.) The room's exterior walls do not seem to be affected in any way by the conditions on the inside, nor does the door or the rest of the building.<br />
<strong>Date of Containment:</strong> 3-21-20██<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> Room ██, ███████ building, CERN, France-Switzerland borders<br />
<strong>Security Protocol:</strong> Normal door replaced with a reinforced titanium security blast door, windows covered with bricks, cover story about &quot;the room being contaminated during a chemical experiment&quot; leaked to the public<br />
Note: Plans to send a probe through the door have been rejected by the Overseer Council.</p>
<p><strong>Location Description:</strong> An In-N-Out Burger restaurant where the burgers seem to always be pink (uncooked), no matter how long they’ve been cooked for. Investigation of the kitchen has revealed nothing wrong with any of the kitchen appliances.<br />
<strong>Date of Containment:</strong> ████-██-██<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> A town in California.<br />
<strong>Security Protocol:</strong> Restaurant shut down under guise of bugs in the kitchen. All workers were given amnestics. The customers naturally forgot about the anomaly on their own.<br />
Note: All In-N-Outs should be placed under surveillance in the event that another one has the same (or a similar) anomaly.</p>
<p><strong>Location Description:</strong> A door in [REDACTED] High School, Anglesey, Wales that when opened goes into the lobby of the [REDACTED] Museum in Kingston Upon Hull, England.<br />
<strong>Date of Containment:</strong> 2019-09-25<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> ████████, Anglesey, Wales<br />
<strong>Security Protocol:</strong> The entrance has been sealed off and disguised as an electrical outlet. Any subjects who had reportedly stepped through the door has been questioned before receiving Class-A amnesiac. No further action has been taken.</p>
<p><strong>Location Description:</strong> A traditional thatched cottage of local design. Previously used as a shelter by locals, whenever the Structure and the immediately surrounding area is left uninhabited, it relocates seemingly at random. No other anomolous effect has been discovered.<br />
<strong>Date of Containment:</strong> ████-██-██<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> ████████, County Mayo, Ireland.<br />
<strong>Security Protocol:</strong> It is currently used as a Holiday home for Foundation employees who show outstanding commitment to work. The schedule has been organized such as that the structure is never uninhabited, thus preventing it from relocating.</p>
<p><strong>Location Description:</strong> Not a shed that is not located within Michigan that does not have some memetic effect that only allows it to be described in falsehoods.<br />
<strong>Date of Containment:</strong> Totally not 3/6/2012<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> Definitely not ████████, Michigan<br />
<strong>Security Protocol:</strong> The location in question has not been purchased by Foundation operatives and is not currently used to store low priority anomalous objects.<br />
Note: This totally wasn't frustrating to write about -Dr. Smith</p>
<p><strong>Location Description:</strong> A cavern where a continuous rain of 0.762cm per hour occurs. The rain has no source, but rather appears 0.5cm from the surface of the cave. No clouds are in the cave. The cavern is a solutional cave spacious enough to allow for upright walking. It extends for five kilometers. The cavern is flooded by water at a depth of approximately 5cm. Inspite of the unceasing precipitation, the water never increases in depth, nor does it ever subside. No source for the water or rain has been discovered.<br />
<strong>Date of Containment:</strong> 2006-06-30<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> ██████████████ Forest, ██°██′██″N ██°██′██″W<br />
<strong>Security Protocol:</strong> The site is secured by chain link fencing, and has a constant security patrol of at least two guards. The fence has signage indicating the area is restricted by penalty of federal law. At least one research scientist team is on site during operational hours.</p>
<p><strong>Location Description:</strong> Conference room A-265 of Duke Energy Convention Center. Whenever anyone inside the room perceives textual, auditory, or visual representations of any element of any projects that British animator James Baxter participated in, they will point at it and repeat the words &quot;JAAAAAMES BAXTER&quot; for 2 minutes. (If the item in question is an article of clothing, the person wearing the clothing will be unaffected.)<br />
<strong>Date of Containment:</strong> 2012-██-██<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> Cincinnati, Ohio, USA<br />
<strong>Security Protocol:</strong> The room has been sealed off. All persons beleived to have entered the room have been interviewed and, if necessary, amnesticized.</p>
<p><strong>Location Description:</strong> A house in Sacramento, California at which a small green parakeet flies across the same patch of sky and disappears every two Fridays. Attempts to catch the bird have failed, as it will disappear after approximately five (5) minutes. Attempts to interact with it have also failed due to it disappearing the moment touched.<br />
<strong>Date of Containment:</strong> 5-25-2016<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> Sacramento, CA, USA<br />
<strong>Security Protocol:</strong> Residents seem to have no interest in the bird whatsoever, deeming containment unnecessary. Personnel who have witnessed the flight of the bird seem to forget the event after one (1) day.</p>
<p><strong>Location Description:</strong> An irregularly shaped approximately 1km squared area of land bordering the Black Sea where upon entering during nighttime, various phenomena occur:</p>
<ul>
<li>All water within the area appears to be a black color, removing the black water from the area returns it to a normal blue color.</li>
<li>A rhythmic, droning sound can be heard from an unidentified location, those who enter the area describe the sound as coming from &quot;around their head&quot;.</li>
<li>Individuals who remain in the area during anomalous activity for more than 10 minutes reported a &quot;dreadful feeling&quot; and &quot;that they did not feel welcome&quot;.</li>
<li>All light emitting devices malfunction and are unable to produce light until taken out of the area.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Date of Containment:</strong> 2004-07-04<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> [REDACTED], Russia<br />
<strong>Security Protocol:</strong> Area has been fenced off and guards have been set up around the area; intruders are to be arrested and if during the anomalous phenomena, amnesticized as well.</p>
<p><strong>Location Description:</strong> A playground where the truck-esque climbing area changes from a firetruck to an ambulance to a train engine to a space ship in random patterns every day.<br />
<strong>Date of Containment:</strong> 2002-06-27<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> Playground in Revere, MA, USA<br />
<strong>Security Protocol:</strong> Playground equipment replaced with non-anomalous firetruck playing equipment. Anomalous equipment placed in low-tier anomaly storage at Site-██.</p>
